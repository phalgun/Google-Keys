Google Keys
===========

Chrome extension to enable keyboard shortcuts for Google search results. 

How to use
----------

**_Ctrl+Shift+1_** opens the first link of the results page in a new tab in the background.
It is just like using **_Ctrl+mouse click_**

**_Alt+Shift+1_** opens the first link of the results page in the same tab.
It is just like using your **_mouse click_** on a search result.

Similary, replace the number with the desired result position.

If you want to open the 3rd link in a new tab, use **_Ctrl+Shift+3_**
If you want to open the 5th link in the same tab, use **_Alt+Shift+5_**

**Ctrl+Shift+number** and **Alt+Shift+number** are your friends! 

How to install
--------------

- Get the source bundle and extract.
- Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox:  The menu's icon is three horizontal bars and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).
- Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
- Click Load unpacked extension to pop up a file-selection dialog.
- Navigate to the directory in which the extracted extension files live, and select it. 

**_Happy browsing!_**

**PS** : I will package the extension and publish it on the Chrome store once I add more goodness to the extension. Features like customizable shortcut combinations and an easy on/off switch to toggle the shortcuts are in the pipeline. 

If you do like the extension, send me some love!
